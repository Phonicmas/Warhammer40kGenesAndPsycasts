# Warhammer 40k - Genes and Psycasts for rimworld

## Suggestions
https://forms.gle/5YpXFs7UgMokhvYa7

## Future Things?
1. Make a standalone psycast mod

## To do (Not ordered)
1. Make nurgles rot transform pawn into plaugebearer upon death.
2. Make custom code to remove/prevent hediffs from getting applied, anything not warp caused.
3. Make progenoid glands give an additional harvest of gene-seeds when a pawn dies.
4. Make greater daemon sprites for all gods.
5. Give Khorne marked pawns special abilities that grows stronger the more they've killed.
6. Give daemon respawn some effect
7. Make more chaos genes, like tentacle of tzeentch or mouth of nurgle, make them work on the ritual system. Maybe a random chance to get a beneficial mutation or a bad one.
8. Special effect for daemon ressurection and summoning.

## Ideas
1. Pawns not marked by khorne go beserk when wielding hellblade?

## Fixes to do
1. Psytrainer quest reward giving access to paths without psyker gene. (VPE thing, need to look into code and harmony fix it?)
2. diseaseProgressionFactor might stop some diseases from healing (Such as nurgles rot)
3. Psyker paths telling missing mark when present? (User mistake by not having psyker gene? IF so try make it such that it tells them instead of just missing mark OR tell either is missing)
4. Issues with ascending apparenly.  (Cant seem to reproduce bug)

## Genes
First 19 gene-seed have a complexity of 2, all 3 primaris have a complexity of 4 and requires 1 archite capsule.
